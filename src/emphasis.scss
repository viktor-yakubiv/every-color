 * Emphasis
 *
 * Applies emphasis level to text and icons. Could be major — high, contrasting
 * well with the surface, or minor (medium) — contrasting with surface to
 * be noticed but do not create noise.
 *
 * If appears on semantic surface, always respects it's color even if combined
 * with own accent.
